# browsercheck-v2
Browsercheck javascript library

The following functions are deprecated but still present:
*checkFlash: always return false
*getFlashVer : always return "0.0.0"
*checkMic: always return true

Those three functions were only used for Flash. Flash has been deprecated by Adobe and the main browsers.
